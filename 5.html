        // Here var is a globale variable declaration
        // first i declared Anjali then kp with same var name ,in other programming languge it will show error but here we didnt got any erroe instead of that 'Anjali'is being overwritten by 'Kp'
        var name = "Anjali"
        var name = "kp"
        console.log(name)


        //here on using Let the problem with var can be resolved 
        //on declaring the same variable name within a block will not overwrite the string
        //here first it will print 'kp'-(outside block) then 'Anjali'-(inside block)
        let urname = 'Anjali'

        console.log(urname)

        //use let no onwards instead of var-------------------------------------------

        //declaring const 
        const hername = 'sneha'  //This will remain constant through out the program .ie cannot be replaced with other variable ... var or let can be changed along the program but not const
        console.log(hername)
